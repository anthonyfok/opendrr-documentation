# Questions/TODO

1. What are all the different types of GeoPackage files, where are they, and what are they for?

    - OpenDRR/boundaries: \*.7z, hexgrid_3857/\*.7z, hexgrid_4326/\*.7z
    - OpenDRR/national-human-settlement: physical-exposure/data/\*.zip, social-fabric/data/\*.zip
    - OpenDRR/seismic-risk-model: data/national/psra\_\*.zip, data/province/??/psra\_\*.zip
    - OpenDRR/earthquake-scenarios: FINISHED/geopackages/\*.zip

    In Will’s “indicators” backup:

    - 1.\_national_human_settlement_layers
    - 2.\_seismic_risk
    - 3.\_earthquake_scenario_risk

2. Measure how much RAM is needed by 7-Zip to decompress some of the larger *.7z files.  (Anthony’s computer started swapping heavily when trying to test)

3. List actual commits as examples.
